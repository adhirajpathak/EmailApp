# EmailApp
Created a Java Application used to create new email accounts at a company with various departments. <br />

* The program generates an email address with firstname.lastname@department.company.com <br />
* The program allows the user to enter which department they are from (Eg: Sales, Accounting, Development). <br />
* The program tells the user the name, email, mailbox capacity and defines an alternative email address. <br />
